# Automated similarity search for 3D scanned archaeological artefacts

This project compares various artefacts through point cloud registration and clustering, for more information see: (paper link coming here) 


## Installation
The requirements for the project can be found in pyproject.toml, and is known to work with poetry.

## Getting started

The examples folder contains various scripts. The paper pipeline essentially consist on running script 0-2 in sequential order.

Note that in order to utilize these scripts you will need a set of 3D files, either mesh files (.stl) or point cloud files (.pc). In the data folder there is a python script for downloading the 3D files for the artefacts used in the article.
